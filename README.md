# Mint Official Website

-  I'm developing this website for a student community in [Yildiz Technical University](https://yildiz.edu.tr/en) 
- You can reach current version of the website via [this link](https://iaesteyildiz.netlify.app/)

## About The Project

- I designed and developed this website by myself.
- I used React and styled-components for css. 
- I get the icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- I imported the font families from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). I used Oxygen.

## Here Some Screenshots From The Project
